## What is Obsidian?
Instead of me explaining what [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is and how to use it, I suggest you visit [the YouTube channel of Linking Your Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88&list=PL3NaIVgSlAVLHty1-NuvPa9V0b0UwbzBd) and watch a few of those free videos. Alternatively, [the help section of the Obsidian website](https://help.obsidian.md/Start+here) has detailed documentation that is worth a read.

Both resources walk you through the basics of how Obsidian works and what you can expect in the tool and its files. I strongly urge you to go watch those short videos, read the docs, and take notes. 

## Templates
These templates are suggestions of how the Obsidian notetaking tool can be used during an OSINT investigation.  The example data in those files should allow you to make some connections _(see what I did there?)_ between how you record your data during an investigation and some of what the tool can offer. 

> [!tip] SOP Tasks
> Consider adding your Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) tasks to the templates so they automatically populate when you make new notes.+

### Use the Templates
- I created the [[person]] and [[domain or ip]] templates to illustrate how you can templatize the information you might need to collect during an investigation.
- Consider creating your own templates for other data you need to collect and placing those files in the `-- templates` directory.
- Modify the existing templates to customize them for your needs.

## Linking Files
- One of the most powerful features in Obsidian is the linking of data through Wikilink `[[]]` tags or a hashtag (`#`). 
- As you will see in the example case files ([[Allister Kemp]]), Obsidian's ability to link files and tag each with arbitrary tags that YOU make up, is an incredible feature.
- The "Graph View"  (`ctrl-G` or `Cmd-G`) will use those links you create and show you related content. 

## Tasks
- The [[-tasks for example files]] page automatically aggregates all tasks in this vault.
- To make a task or "to do" item, start a bullet with `[ ] WHAT YOU WANT THE TASK TO BE`. Examples can be found [[Isiah Kemp#Username s]] and [[Gabriella Parkington#Residences]]

## Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Template
- Check out the files in the **Standard Operating Procedures** area like the [[Username]] file.
- That directory path is an example to demonstrate how you can build your SOP (or links to sites you use) into your vault and keep it separate.

## Look At The Examples
I created several example notes for you to see just some of the capabilities of this tool and these templates. I suggest starting with your #primary #poi [[Allister Kemp]].
