 ## Mapping Ancestors
 - Once you have completed the family tree, you can click on open local graph to get a graph view, but the Mind Map is much better for viewing the Tree.

 ## How to get the Mind Map plugin in Obsidian
 - Go to **Settings** (bottom-left)--> **Community Plugins** --> **Turn off Safe Mode** --> **Browse Community Plugins** --> **Type Mind Map** --> **Install**
 - The code to this plugin is open source and can be found here: [Obsidian Mind Map by James Lynch](https://github.com/lynchjames/obsidian-mind-map)

 <br>

 ## Template 
 - You will notice that each person has 2 sets of brackets around them, example: [[Father]], this lets you do a right click on each person and --> create file.
 - You can have a file on each person and you can input much more detailed information such as full name, date of birth, place of Birth, date of death, text/many notes and any amount of text, import screenshots, photos, .txt files etc.. 
 - [Download this Template](https://github.com/C3n7ral051nt4g3ncy/obsidian-osint-templates/blob/main/--%20templates/Ancestry_template.md) in .md format, then, in Obsidian click **create new Vault** --> **create new file** --> and simply **drag the Ancestry_template.md file into the newly created file.**
